I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. Here, I have showcased some of my personal cybersecurity projects, but I have other projects/repos posted that fall outside the cybersecurity umbrella. Some of my other projects include fullstack, data mining, API integrations, and database management. 

## Objective

As someone that developed a passion for technology and innovation from an early age, I have used this ambition and drive to begin exploring the cybersecurity field. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science in computer science, and with hands on expreince in IT help desk and networking roles, I aim to eventually advance my career to an Information Security Analyst postion, and then a Security Engineer. To reach these milestones, I plan on earning relevant certifications, as well as obtaining a Master's in Information Technology or Cybersecurity in the near future.
