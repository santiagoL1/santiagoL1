I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

Graduating with a Bachelor of Science in computer science, and with hands on expreince in IT help desk and networking roles, I aim to eventually advance my career to an Information Security Analyst postion, and then a Security Engineer. To reach these milestones, I plan on earning relevant certifications, as well as obtaining a Master's in Information Technology or Cybersecurity in the near future.
